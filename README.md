My first website using HTML5 and CSS3 (newbie)


<p>Well, first let me talk a little about me...
I'm graduated in Advertising and Marketing and I'm working now with Digital Solutions, special in Business Intelligence.</P>

<p>My boyfriend are a Developer Specialist since a lot of years, and talking with him I  was pretty curious about how to learn codes, HTML, CSS, Java, Phyto, etc. 
Of course, I'm a newbie, so... you can't expect so much about me. lol</p>

<p>This is my first project using HTML5 and CSS3. I used the program "Atom" and read a lot of articles in websites, had my boyfriend's support, watched videos and finaly I created an acount here =)</P>
